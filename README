PoscHP - OSC for PHP

INTRO

Right now all i have here is a proof of concept binary stream parser
based on a simple state machine. This was written mainly to show that
such a thing is feasible without needing to hack much C. For a fully
working OSC implementation for PHP this still needs heaps of work.

QUICKSTART

 git clone git://github.com/hairmare/PoscHP.git
 cd PoscHP
 php osctest.php &
 oscsend localhost 10000 /replay/status \
         iisisi 1 10047 "20110606-190002" 3600 "SGVsbGFzIFJhZGlvCg==" 1

TODO (in no particular order)

- Daemon Infrastructure (based on pear/System_Daemon?)
- OSC Sending Framework (see http://andy.schmeder.net/files/OSC.phps)
- stable logging and exception handling
- fix OSC Float support (maybe andy.scheders code contains the hint)
- add tons of documentation
- find a way to read the dest ip and port (patch socket_recvfrom?)
- get rid of remaining getResult called on unfinished parse problems
